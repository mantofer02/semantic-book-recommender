# Semantic Book Recommender

This project is based on the course from FreeCodeCamp on YouTube. The idea is to create a book recommender system that uses semantic search to find books based on user queries. It uses an LLM (Large Language Model) to process the queries and find relevant books from a dataset.

## Dataset

- 7K books dataset from Kaggle: [Books Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dylanjcastillo/7k-books-with-metadata)
